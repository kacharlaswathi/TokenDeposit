1. Used separate contract for slabs to simulate the transfer of erc20 tokens.
2. Since a separate contract is used, configuration for max capacity and available capacity can be maintained inside slab contract.
2. Deployer for slab contract will be DepositToken contract, so only DepositToken contract can update the filled capacity.
3. Since slabs are predefined, created slabs in constructor.
